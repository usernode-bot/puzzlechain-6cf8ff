/* ============================================================
   Word Sprint — daily Boggle-style timed word grid (change-list item 6).
   Trace adjacent letters (8 directions, no reuse) on today's seeded 4×4
   grid and bank as many valid words as you can in 90 seconds. Open
   vocabulary against the in-file WSPR word set; longer words score more.
   The countdown ending is the "win" (score may be 0 — an empty sprint
   still locks the day but never breaks a streak).
