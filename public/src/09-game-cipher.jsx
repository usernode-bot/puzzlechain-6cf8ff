   Game 3 — Crypto Wordle (daily variable-length finance/crypto word)
   ============================================================ */
// The daily word now varies in length (3–8 letters). The board sizes its
// columns to the word and allows wordLen + 1 guesses (see cwMaxGuesses).
const CW_MIN_LEN = 3;
const CW_MAX_LEN = 8;

// Curated finance / crypto terms of VARYING length (3–8 letters), each with a
// short themed clue the player reads while solving. The daily answer is chosen
// deterministically from this list, so everyone gets the same word + length +
// clue on the same UTC day (shareable, comparable). No dictionary validates the
// guesses — any letters of the right length are accepted — but the answer is
// always from here. Every `word` must be UPPERCASE A–Z and 3–8 letters.
// Each entry: `clue` is the always-visible main clue; `hints` is an ordered
// list of EXTRA clues (default 2) that unlock progressively — one per wrong
// guess, or early via the paid Hint button. Keep hints incremental and
// spoiler-light (never spell the word).

   #138 — "Daily cipher is the same every day".
   The seeding was fine (consecutive-day PRNG streams are well separated); the
   pool was the problem: 42 words, ONE theme, 4–7 drawn per day, no cross-day
   memory. Two words recurring inside a week is what made it feel identical.

   Fix: three more themed pools (≥180 entries total) plus a deterministic
   ROTATION that partitions a seeded shuffle into day-sized blocks, so a word
   cannot recur inside a full cycle. Verified by the cipher-rotation self-test.

/* The day's words, purely from the UTC day number.

   PARTITION, not sampling. Each theme is shuffled ONCE (fixed seed) and cut

   blocks. Because the slot index just walks the blocks cyclically, ANY window
   of CW_CYCLE_LEN consecutive days touches each theme's blocks at most once —
   a *sliding* no-repeat guarantee, which is what a player actually experiences.

   An earlier version reshuffled per cycle to also vary which words appear
   together. That broke the sliding property at every cycle boundary (a window
   straddling two shuffles could repeat a word days apart), so it was dropped:
   the fixed partition is the property worth having, and the visible fix for
