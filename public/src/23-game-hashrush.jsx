/* #215 — TAP TO MINE.

   Hash Rush used to be a dodger: you steered a miner between three lanes,
   collected what it ran into and lost a life when it ran into a hazard. That
   made the hazard something you avoided by MOVING and made the lightning
   bolt nearly meaningless, because grabbing a second one simply reassigned
   the boost timer and threw away whatever was left of the first.

   It is now a striking game. Nothing steers. You hit what falls:

     mine    tapping a hash breaks it — HR_TOKEN_SCORE, doubled while boosted
     bolt    tapping lightning ADDS HR_BOOST_SECS to the boost you already
             have (up to HR_BOOST_MAX) instead of replacing it, so two bolts
             are worth twice one
     TNT     tapping one costs HR_TNT_PENALTY points. It is the one thing you
             are meant to leave alone, so the penalty is the whole hazard —
             it no longer takes a life, because there is nothing to dodge
     miss    a hash that reaches the floor un-mined costs a life. That is the
             failure this game has now, and it is what ends an endless run

   The lanes stay: they are what makes a strike aimable on a phone (a lane is
   130 px wide at 390 px) and they keep the seeded spawn stream meaningful.
*/

/* #176 — three modes over one loop.

   Hash Rush was pure endless score-attack driven by Math.random(), which is
   fine for a classic and disqualifying for a daily: two players would face
   different hazards and their scores would not be comparable. So the spawn
   stream is now drawn from a seeded rng in every mode except free play, and
   the modes differ only in how the shift is BOUNDED:

     daily  — a fixed 90-second shift over the day's spawn stream. Everyone
              gets the same stream in the same order.
     story  — six rungs, each longer, faster and denser than the last.
     arcade — endless, with the band setting the starting pressure.

   #215 gave the two bounded modes a TARGET as well: running the clock out is
   no longer the whole of clearing a shift, you have to have mined enough. */

   1/spawnEvery — against how many a hand can actually make. The ladder below

   what that is being measured against. */

/* THE SPAWN SCHEDULE IS A FUNCTION OF ELAPSED TIME, NOT OF FRAMES.

   The old loop accumulated a `spawnT` and fired when it crossed the interval,
   which overshoots by up to one frame EVERY spawn — so a slow device was
   dealt a measurably shorter stream than a fast one over the same 90 seconds.
   That was survivable while the score was just "how long did you last". It is
   not survivable now: a daily whose length depends on the phone holding it is
   not a daily, and a level target derived from the stream would mean a
   different thing on every device.

   So the times are derived from `elapsed` and the loop only asks which ones
   have passed. hrSpawnPlan walks the same recurrence ahead of time, which is
   what lets the target below be computed from the level's real stream rather
   than guessed. Keep the two using hrEveryAt/hrDrawObj — they are one rule
   with two readers. */

/* WHAT A LEVEL ASKS FOR IS MEASURED, NOT PICKED.

   "Clear winning thresholds per level" needs a number per level, and a number
   somebody eyeballed would be wrong the moment any of the constants above
   moved — the same trap TM_LAYOUTS and MJ_LAYOUTS document. So the target is
   derived from the level's OWN spawn stream at the start of the run, by
   playing it with an explicit model of a player:

     - taps at most HR_MODEL_TPS times a second, sustained
     - cannot react to a spawn for HR_MODEL_LAG
     - loses anything it has not reached within HR_MODEL_REACH of the spawn
       (roughly how long an object is on screen; the real fall is 2.0-3.8 s
       depending on band and ramp, so this is the conservative end)
     - never taps a TNT, and taps bolts as they come

   The target is HR_TARGET_FRACTION of what that model scores. Because story
   seeds are stable per band and the daily seed is the same for everybody, two
   players on the same level get the same target.

   0.7 is where it is because of a second measurement. Re-running each level
   300 times with a player who mines only a FRACTION of the hashes it reaches
   and fumbles into some of the TNT gives, as a share of the perfect model:

     mines 95%, hits 3% of TNT      0.92  0.93  0.92  0.92  0.94  0.93
     mines 85%, hits 8% of TNT      0.78  0.78  0.78  0.77  0.81  0.79
     mines 72%, hits 15% of TNT     0.58  0.59  0.60  0.59  0.64  0.59
                                     L1    L2    L3    L4    L5    L6

   So 0.7 clears for an accurate-but-not-perfect player at every level and
   does not clear for a ragged one. Note how FLAT those rows are: the ladder's
   difficulty is carried entirely by stream density and TNT share, which is
   why one constant does the job and a per-level ramp would only be a second
   copy of the ladder. Note also that the tap BUDGET never binds — the model
   misses at most one object a level even at 3.1 spawns a second, because it
   only ever strikes hashes and bolts. The thing this game asks for is
   accuracy, not speed, and HR_MODEL_TPS is currently not the binding term.

   HR_TARGET_FRACTION IS THE SINGLE BALANCE KNOB. Move it, not the individual
   numbers — there are no individual numbers. What no simulation can tell you
   is what share a real hand actually mines on a phone; that is a playtest,
   and it is the one input here I could not measure. */

/* #215 — Hash Rush no longer draws an end panel of its own, and that is the
   whole of the reported "brief glitchy Play Again".

   Phase 1 (#160) gave it a `resultShown` prop so its panel would stand down
   once App's shared results card owned the ending. Standing down turned out to
   be ALL it ever did: `reportRunEnd` always reaches `onWin`/`onLose`, so a
   shared card always follows, and the panel only ever existed in the gap
   before one arrived. Measured in a browser:

     free play  — the classic branch of handleWin sets winData synchronously,
                  so the panel never rendered at all. Dead code.
     arcade     — that branch AWAITS /api/arcade/:id/finish first, so the panel
                  committed for one paint and was swapped for the shared card
                  32 ms later against a local stub; over a real network it is a
                  whole round trip. Daily and story await too.
     Play Again — clearing winData drops `resultShown` a commit BEFORE the
                  resetKey effect returns the game to idle, so the panel
                  flashed a second time, in the exact spot the button was.

   So the panel is deleted rather than re-timed: there is no state in which it
   is the ending the player is meant to read. `finalRank` went with it — the
   "Global rank #N" line it carried arrives after `submitClassicScore`
   resolves, by which time the shared card is already on top of it.

   The reset is a LAYOUT effect for the same reason: it has to run before the
   paint that follows Play Again, or the dead board shows for a frame. */
